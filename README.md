DALL-E is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by OpenAI. It is an extension of the GPT-3 architecture and is designed to generate images from textual descriptions. 

This is a Full Stack MERN project where I created a clone of DALL-E and will be working on AI APIs from OpenAI.
